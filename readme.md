# Proletariat Bot

Proletariat Bot is a Discord bot writen in Node.js using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) npm library. This is the fourth iteration of the bot, a great-grandson of the original, if you will. Well technically the fifth, but I've repressed the memories of my original Proletariat Bot project so I can't tell you anything about it.

## Usage

The prefix for this bot is `p!`. Use `p!help` to see a list of commands and how to use them.

My Discord profile is `Roger#4803`; contact me if you have any questions. Or just figure it out by yourself. Your call.

## Contributing

Shoot me a DM if you want anything added to the bot. I might consider it. Or I might not.
I don't think anyone wants to make a pull request for this shitty code but feel free.
